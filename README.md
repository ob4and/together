# t★gether ⭐️  
**Role-based Collaboration Platform for Juniors**

## Overview
**t★gether** is a lightweight collaboration platform designed to help  
planners, designers, and developers connect naturally and start working together.

By bringing scattered communities, project posts, and collaboration tools  
into a single flow, t★gether lowers the barrier to collaboration—especially  
for juniors who are unsure where or how to begin.
